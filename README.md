## Current Active Topics

### Your freelancing on autopilot with airtable ðŸ†•

One of my biggest concerns as a freelance is finding new clients. I am a solo entrepreneur. If I am not looking for new job opportunities every week, I am in a risky position.
One day â€”for a random reasonâ€” I can quickly lose all my clients. Literally that's what happened 2 weeks ago, with something that no one could have predicted: a global world pandemic.
__I lost 66.66% of my clients in one day.__

How can I work on my client's projects and sell my services in the meantime? __Let me introduce you to all my automation protips.__

### React Native and React Native Web ðŸ†•

Publish cross-platform applications is an old problem like the web. In 2019, Twitter has deployed its new version with a single codebase! What are their secrets ? Investigationâ€¦

### Static websites in the era of Headless CMS ðŸ†•

Static sites rebuild on every change, but thatâ€™s actually far less often than a classic server-hosted web application (which rebuilds on every request). With a `JAMstack` you can use JavaScript, APIs, and Markup to deploy fast and secure website. Come learn how to glue together `GitHub`, `Gatsby`, `Contentful` and `Netlify`.

### Productivity and automation for hackers ðŸ†•

Did you know that â€”on averageâ€” adults can focus 20 min maximum on a task? Especially when you are a developer, you need to "get on the zone" and avoid switching context at all costs. In this talk I am sharing all my productivity hacks to automate my life.

### Chatbot Workshop

One of the major changes in social paradigm is how people are consuming content. Now, people are spending more time on chat applications rather than social media! So what are conversationnal applications? How is it implemented? Where should you put them? Why did Facebook invest in messenger and whatsapp? Come learn how chatbot can help increassing your convertion rate, improve user experience, and more.

### Leadmachine Worshop

Nowadays all the web is about `API`'s. Do you think buidling a static website is a simple thing?
In the world of the `JAMSTACK`, it's not so simple but you will discover the advantages of using powerfull tools like `React` and `Gatsby` for the website, `Netifly` for Continius Integration. In the meantime, we are going to explore the possibilities offered by [Typeform](http://referral.typeform.com/mzclYBD) and `Zapier`.

Because the speaker have a Growth Hacking Mindset, he will introduce you how he hacked `Typeform` and `Slack` to build a comunity platform.
Looking for real life use cases for your own company? For example, if you want to improve the journey of new employee and develop a great onboarding â€“ the automation way, this workshop is for you.

### Debug your design _like a boss_

Level up your front-end development skills using the Google Chrome Developer tools!
This talk cover the tools and best practices for front-end designers, given at an exclusive Meetup at Googleâ€™s Brussels HQ.

### Git and GitHub 101

Git is one of the most powerfull tool for people working in the web industry. The first part of this workshop will focus on the core functionality of `git` - commit, branching and merging. After we understand the basics, we are going to see how to use GitHub to ship features when we are writing code together.
