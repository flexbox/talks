### Design system styling in React Native —From zero to hero 🆕

With React Native, you style your application using `JavaScript` and `CSS-in-JS`.

Let's explore together how to create a first-class developer experience when managing styles and themes with `TypeScript` and `restyle`!

### Create your first book as an indie hacker 🆕

Last year David published his first book.
You may ask yourself: what kind of tools should I use to write a book ?
You can start with a simple document on a text editor... but you will miss the most important part: distribution.
During this talk you will learn how to create, automate and distribute your first book as a indie hacker.

### Your freelancing on autopilot with airtable 🆕

One of my biggest concerns as a freelance is finding new clients. I am a solo entrepreneur. If I am not looking for new job opportunities every week, I am in a risky position.
One day —for a random reason— I can quickly lose all my clients. Literally that's what happened 2 weeks ago, with something that no one could have predicted: a global world pandemic.
__I lost 66.66% of my clients in one day.__

How can I work on my client's projects and sell my services in the meantime? __Let me introduce you to all my automation protips.__

### React Native and React Native Web

### Static websites in the era of Headless CMS

Static sites rebuild on every change, but that’s actually far less often than a classic server-hosted web application (which rebuilds on every request). With a `JAMstack` you can use JavaScript, APIs, and Markup to deploy fast and secure website. Come learn how to glue together `GitHub`, `Gatsby`, `Contentful` and `Netlify`.

### Productivity and automation for hackers

Did you know that —on average— adults can focus 20 min maximum on a task? Especially when you are a developer, you need to "get on the zone" and avoid switching context at all costs. In this talk I am sharing all my productivity hacks to automate my life.

### Git and GitHub 101

Git is one of the most powerfull tool for people working in the web industry. The first part of this workshop will focus on the core functionality of `git` - commit, branching and merging. After we understand the basics, we are going to see how to use GitHub to ship features when we are writing code together.

Come learn how chatbot can help increassing your convertion rate, improve user experience, and more.

### Leadmachine Worshop

Nowadays all the web is about `API`'s. Do you think buidling a static website is a simple thing?
In the world of the `JAMSTACK`, it's not so simple but you will discover the advantages of using powerfull tools like `React` and `Gatsby` for the website, `Netifly` for Continius Integration. In the meantime, we are going to explore the possibilities offered by [Typeform](http://referral.typeform.com/mzclYBD) and `Zapier`.

Because the speaker have a Growth Hacking Mindset, he will introduce you how he hacked `Typeform` and `Slack` to build a comunity platform.
